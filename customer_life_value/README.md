This is a case study from Kellogg School of Management. I will show how to calculate the CLV given the churn rate, discount rate, variable and marketing cost.

# Case Introduction
Home Alarm was one of the largest privately held alarm security services companies in the US, which offered customers a complete range of security solutions, including intrusion detection, fire detection, access control, and video surveillance. 

Due to its excellent customer service Home Alarm had a much lower customer churn rate than its publicly traded competitors, so they had provided data to the students as part of a class project to identify the major
factors driving customer churn. One interesting finding is that customers on autopay were less likely to churn, but the students had not been able to quantify how important the effect was.  In particular, the decision maker wanted to know how much more profitable a customer using autopay was compared to a
customer that did not use autopay. The answer to this question seemed key to decision makers because it would tell him how much he could spend on sales force and customer incentives to sign up customers for autopay. The right approach was to calculate the <b>CLV (Customer Life Value)</b> of a typical customer with and without autopay. 

| Attrition notifications during: | autopay | no_autopay |
|:-------------------------------:|:-------:|:----------:|
|                1                |  0.032  |    0.084   |
|                2                |   0.07  |    0.122   |
|                3                |  0.097  |    0.162   |
|                4                |  0.103  |    0.154   |
|                5                |  0.095  |    0.134   |
|                6                |  0.078  |    0.12    |
|                7                |  0.069  |    0.111   |
|                8                |  0.059  |    0.096   |
|                9                |  0.053  |    0.086   |

Note: The percentages in the table reflect the customers that notified Home Alarm that they would not renew their contract for the following year (i.e., 3.2% of autopay customers active in year 1 did not renew for year 2). 

# Key assumption
Some other key assumptions:
1. The average RMR for customers was going to be $40 during the coming year, so that $480 would be the right number for the first full year of the CLV calculation. For each subsequent year the revenue from each customer could be assumed to increase by 3% due to general rate increases.
2. Home Alarm had traditionally assumed an annual discount rate of 10%
3. Variable cost were 15% of RMR, i.e., $6 per month, increasing by 3% each year due to general rate increases. 
4. Home Alarm spent about 5% of RMR on marketing to each existing customer, i.e., $2 per month, increasing by 3% per year due to general rate increases. 
5. The company charged $195 for installation but the cost to the firm was $492 on average. 

# Goal of the project
Goals:
Consider existing residential customers who are about to start their 2nd year with Home Alarm, we need to answer the following questions:
1. the CLV (looking 8 years out) of a customer who uses autopay/ doesn't use autopay.
2.  the maximum amount Home Alarm should spend on incentives to convert an existing customer to autopay
3.  Suggest some marketing actions Home Alarm should consider to convert existing customers to autopay who are about to start their second year with Home Alarm.
