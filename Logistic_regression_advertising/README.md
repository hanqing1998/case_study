This is a case study from Foster School of Business and Rady School of Management

# Case Introduction
Tz-gaming purchases impressions from Vneta to advertise to app users. They could not only buy impressions making prediction models themselves or they could  ask Vneta to make analysis helping target customer. The decision maker wants to compare the following 4 options and see which one could generate the most profit.

Options:
1. Spam all propects
2. Continue with the current targeting approach
3. Use predictions from a logistic regression model for ad targeting 
4. Use predictions generated by Vneta for ad targeting

The assumptions used for the analysis are as follows:
- Targeting of impressions to consumers covered by the Vneta ad-network to date has been (approxi- mately) random
- Cost per 1,000 video impressions (CPM) is $10
- Conversion to sign-up as a TZ game player after clicking on an ad is 5%
- The expected CLV of customers that sign-up with TZ after clicking on an ad is approximately $25
- The price charged for the data by Vneta is $50K
- The price charged for the data science consulting services by Vneta is $150K

Approach:
- Use the 87,535 rows in the data with “training == ‘train’ ” to estimate different models. Then generate predictions for all 115,488 rows in the dataset
- Options 1-4 should be evaluated only on the predictions generated for the 27,953 rows in the data with “training == ‘test’ ”. These are the observations that were not used to estimate your model
- Extrapolate the cost and benefits for options 1-4 above for an upcoming advertising campaign where TZ will commit to purchase 20-million impressions from Vneta

# Data Description
Each row in the tz_gaming dataset represents an impression. For each row (impression), we have data on 21 variables. All explanatory variables are created by Vneta based on one month tracking history of users, apps, and ads. The available variables are described in below.

- training -- Dummy variable that splits the dataset into a training ("train") and a test ("test") set
- inum -- Impression number
- click -- Click indicator for the TZ ad served in the impression. Equals "yes" if the ad was clicked and "no" otherwise
- time -- The hour of the day in which the impression occurred (1-24). For example, "2" indicates the impression occurred between 1 am and 2 am
- time_fct -- Same as time but the is coded as categorical
- app -- The app in which the impression was shown. Ranges from 1 to 49
- mobile_os -- Customer's mobile OS
- impup -- Number of past impressions the user has seen in the app
- clup -- Number of past impressions the user has clicked on in the app
- ctrup -- Past CTR (Click-Through Rate) (x 100) for the user in the app
- impua -- Number of past impressions of the TZ ad that the user has seen across all apps
- clua -- Number of past impressions of the TZ ad that the user has clicked on across all apps
- ctrua -- Past CTR (x 100) of the TZ ad by the user across all apps
- imput -- Number of past impressions the user has seen within in the hour
- clut -- Number of past impressions the user has clicked on in the hour
- ctrut -- Past CTR (x 100) of the user in the hour
- imppat -- Number of past impressions that showed the TZ ad in the app in the hour
- clpat -- Number of past clicks the TZ ad has received in the app in the hour
- ctrpat -- Past CTR (x 100) of the TZ ad in the app in the hour
- rnd -- Simulated data from a normal distribution with mean 0 and a standard deviation of 1
- pred_vneta -- Predicted probability of click per impressions generated by Vneta's proprietary machine learning algorithm
- id -- Anonymized user ID

Note that there is a clear relationship between the impressions, clicks, and ctr variables within a strata. Specifically:
- ctrup = clup/impup
- ctru = clu/impu
- ctrut = clut/imput
- ctrpat = clpat/impat

The last three letters of a feature indicate the sources of variation in a variable:
- u — denotes user
- t — denotes time
- p — denotes app
- a — denotes ad
